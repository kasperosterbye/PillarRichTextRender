# PillarRichTextRender

### This project was absorbed into Pharo 9.
It will no longer be maintained.

----

Rendering the Pillar markup inside the Pharo image.

This is work in (early) progress, but I think it is far enough for a "technology preview". 

> It currently only works for **Pharo 8**.

The notion of *Rich Text* is simply the Pharo class `Text` as opposed to `String`.

### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to be able to do better in-image documentation. To do this, I am working on several fronts:

1. Rendering more pillar, expecially I would like to get a solution for tables.
2. Rendering github markdown in addition to pillar markdown. This will allow me to pull markdown from git and display it in-image.
3. Giving the "help-system" some love.
4. In-image tools for writing markdown - a markdown editor
4. A design for keeping the mark-down texts seamlessly outside of the image

Reg. 1., I can only figure out how to transform a morphic table into an image, and then add that image to the text (not included atm as I find it so ugly a solution). Any other ideas are greatly appreciated.

Reg. 2. I am nearly done on this one, at least for the easy aspects (headers, lists, emphasis, code-blocks).

Reg 3 and 4. Only loose ideas atm.

### Trying it out

Load it using Metacello:

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
   baseline: 'PillarRichTextRender';
   repository: 'github://kasperosterbye/PillarRichTextRender';
   load.
```

> Warning: this load will redefine a the class and package comment editors of the Calypso browser


Once loaded, the class `PRRichTextComposer` has some examples on the class side.

Once loaded the class comments and package comments will be rendered in pillar. Most such comments are not in pillar. It tries to guess if the comment is pillar or plain text (by looking for a few key markdowns). 

At the moment you cannot edit the rendered text directly, but pressing `meta-r` (also known as `command-r`) will drop out of rendered and into source mode. In source mode you can edit the source. Accepting the changes reverts back to rendered mode.

### Github markdown

In addition to rendering pillar, there is a tool which can render a subset of github markdown (no tables, and a few other issues). You can try the example in `GHMParser class>>example`.

The rendering is done by parsing the github markdown and building a pillar document tree. This tree is then rendered using the pillar rich text rendering.
